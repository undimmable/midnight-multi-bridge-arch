--- abstract

This document explores the implications of introducing Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and multisig cryptographic mechanisms into the SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) model commonly used by Y Combinator startups. The goal is not to enhance the system but to expose its fundamental flaws, demonstrating how partial transparency contradicts its original function and breaks investor incentives. By analyzing the game-theoretic vulnerabilities, we reveal how the SAFE funding model collapses under the weight of cryptographic guarantees.

# Introduction

SAFE agreements have long been used as a mechanism to provide early-stage funding to startups without explicitly defining company valuation at the time of investment. However, this opaque structure enables speculative valuation inflation, leading to a Ponzi-like dynamic. This document introduces an experimental approach to integrating Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and multisig enforcement to demonstrate the structural weaknesses of the SAFE model.

Rather than improving the system, we seek to break it. 

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

- **SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)**: A funding instrument that delays valuation until a later priced round.
- **Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Cryptographic methods that verify truth without revealing underlying information.
- **Multisig (Multi-Signature)**: A requirement that multiple parties sign off on an action before execution.

# Exposing Logical Contradictions

1. **Opacity vs. Transparency**: SAFE agreements rely on information asymmetry. Introducing cryptographic transparency removes the ability for early investors to exploit future valuation speculation.
2. **Investor Incentives Break**: Multisig requirements eliminate unilateral decision-making, removing key speculative advantages.
3. **SAFE Becomes Illiquid**: Without full visibility into ownership structures, secondary market transactions for SAFE become infeasible.

# Game Theoretic Breakdown

The introduction of ZKPs and multisig compliance forces a paradox in investor behavior:
- Investors can no longer assume infinite liquidity due to asymmetric visibility.
- Startup founders lose the ability to selectively disclose financials to maintain valuation manipulation.
- The system collapses under its own speculative nature.

# Security Considerations

By enforcing cryptographic transparency, we introduce security constraints that make SAFE agreements self-sabotaging:
- **ZKPs introduce verifiability but eliminate plausible deniability**
- **Multisig constraints block rapid investor exits, leading to stagnation**
- **Compliance with transparency laws becomes unworkable under dual cryptographic commitments**

This draft is an exploration of the fundamental contradictions within startup investment structures and how cryptographic guarantees force systems to confront their own flaws. A special thanks to the open-source cryptography community for continuing to expose hidden fragilities within financial models.
